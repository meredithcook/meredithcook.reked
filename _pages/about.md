Welcome! My name is Meredith Cook. 

I am married to Keelan and a [stay-at-home-working mom](https://meredithcook.net/2022/05/30/the-stay-at-home-full-time-working-mom/) of two tiny redheads. I serve as the Grant Coordinator for Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, where I earned a Master of Divinity in Missiology. Before grant writing, I was a content editor and writer for various missions organizations, including the International Mission Board and the Upstream Collective. My current writing consists of articles for this site and grant proposals, but you can find my past articles at [IMB](https://www.imb.org/search/meredith+cook/?s=meredith%20cook&sort=relevant), [Upstream Collective](https://www.theupstreamcollective.org/blog/use-the-holidays-to-your-evangelistic-advantage), [Lifeway Research](https://research.lifeway.com/2020/03/31/why-our-worship-and-spiritual-walk-needs-repetition/), the [Center for Faith and Culture blog](https://cfc.sebts.edu/faith-and-work/women-seminary-professors/) at SEBTS, and my [husband's blog](https://keelancook.com/2016/04/29/your-churchs-continued-responsibility-for-its-sent-ones/). 

Now, I write mostly on lessons I'm learning about parenting, habit formation, and the general Christian life. In addition to this blog, I'm writing a children's board book about [the Great Commission and missionaries](https://meredithcook.net/2022/10/18/writing-a-children-book/) with [B&H Kids](https://www.bhpublishinggroup.com/categories/kids/), scheduled to release in Spring 2024. 

When I'm not supplying my kids with snacks, taking them to the playground, or requesting large sums of money from foundations, I enjoy copious amounts of coffee, hiking with my family, reading, and baking. You can also find me on [Twitter](twitter.com/meredithcook716), where I regularly interrupt your timeline with really boring tweets. 

Thanks for stopping by!
