Welcome! My name is Meredith Cook. 

I am a follower of Jesus Christ. Because of my sinful nature, I was separated from God. I had no hope in this world (Ephesians 2). But I was taught the gospel from a very young age by my parents, grandparents, and others in our church. I believed in Jesus Christ, God's only son. Jesus, who lived a perfect life, died on a cross to pay the penalty for my sin. Then he raised from the dead on the third day. Jesus defeated death so that I might live with him forever. By God's grace, I believed this message at nine years old. The Lord has sustained my faith for twenty-five years. I have known him to be gracious, patient, sovereign, good, sustaining, merciful, generous, convicting, and so much more. If He is gracious enough to give me twenty-five more years, I anticipate growing more deeply in my knowledge and experience of Him. If you've happened upon this site and want to know more about this story, feel free to contact me.

I am married to  <u><a href="http://keelancook.com">this guy</a></u> and mom of two. These three humans are the greatest gift the Lord has given me after my salvation. I am so proud to be Keelan's wife but I'll not gross you out (or embarrass him) by gushing. I'm a stay-at-home working mom and am very thankful I get to both. Getting to spend every day with my kids—watching them grow and learn and develop— has been fun, exhausting, joyful, sanctifying, and everything in between. It's also why this site will be a semi-mommy-blog. This is my life right now!

For the last five years, I have worked in content editing and writing for various missions organizations. I am now the Grant Coordinator for Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, from which I also have an M.Div in Missiology. I'm currently writing a children's book about the Great Commission and missionaries with B&H Kids, scheduled to release in Spring 2024. 

I write about Christian living, parenting, theology, and missions. Thanks for stopping by!
