Welcome! My name is Meredith Cook. 

I am a follower of Jesus Christ. Because of my sinful nature, I was separated from God. I had no hope in this world (Ephesians 2). But I was taught the gospel from a very young age by my parents and others in our church. I believed in Jesus Christ, God's only son. Jesus, who lived a perfect life, died on a cross to pay the penalty for my sin. Then he raised from the dead on the third day. Jesus defeated death so that I might live with him forever. By God's grace, I believed this message at nine years old. I have walked with the Lord for 25 years and have known him to be gracious, patient, sovereign, good, sustaining, merciful, generous, convicting, and so much more. If He is gracious enough to give me 25 more years, I anticipate growing more deeply in my knowledge and experience of Him. 

I am married to  <a href="http://keelancook.com">this guy</a> and mom of two. These three humans are the greatest gift the Lord has given me after my salvation. I am super proud to be Keelan's wife but I'll not gross you out (or embarrass him) by gushing. I'm a stay-at-home working mom and am very thankful I get to both. Getting to spend every day with my kids—watching them grow and learn and develop— has been fun, exhausting, joyful, sanctifying, and everything in between.

For the last five years, I have worked in content editing and writing for various missions organizations. I am now the Grant Coordinator for Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary. I am new to this kind of work/writing and have no idea what I'm doing. But it's fun learning a new set of skills within an area that I really enjoy. 

Some other random facts about me: I love coffee and drink entirely too much but hey, I get up really early. I have the great misfortune of cheering for the South Carolina Gamecocks. "Where are you from?" has become a unexpectedly complicated question. I incorporate a Friends or The Office reference in conversation at least once a day, even if people don't catch it. I lived in Houston for five years and completely drank the Texas Kool-Aid. 

Thanks for stopping by. I write about Christian living, parenting, theology, and missions. Hi Mom, thanks for being one of my only readers.
